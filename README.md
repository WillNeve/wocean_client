# Wocean
##What is it?
Wocean, a play on words for a beloved existing notetaking app that I use daily 😉
I have developed this project to showcase skills intigrating a headless nodejs server api into a React SPA.
##Noteable Features:
- Hand built robust authentication system using jason web tokens and [...TBD...] for end to end encryption.
- Carefully design relational database to power document nesting and file attachments using polymorphism
##Stack:
###Front:
- Typescript
- React (React-Router-Dom)
- TailwindCSS
- Front Deployment hosted on Vercel
- Initially bootstrapped with Vite
###Back:
- Node.js (with Express.js)
- Server Deployment hosted on Heroku
- Serverless PostgreSQL hosted on Vercel
